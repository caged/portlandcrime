    <h1>About Portland Crime</h1>
    <p>Portland Crime is an Open Source effort to document and display crime in neighborhoods across Portland, OR.</p>
      
    <h2>Where does your data come from?</h2>
    <p>All of the crime data comes from the City of Portland, OR and is updated daily.  You can <a href="http://www.civicapps.org/datasets/crime-incidents">download the raw datasets here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>How accurate is the data?</h2>
    <p>All our data is taken directly from the City of Portland, OR's raw data dumps.  The data on this site is only as accurate as the data 
      provided by the city.  Some of the data doesn't included a geolocation so you will probably find instances with the number of crimes do not match up with 
      the points on the maps.</p>
    
    <h2>Can I help?</h2>
    <p><strong>Yes!</strong> This project is Open Source.  Anyone can help.  While the project is still small, I encourage you to 
      <%= mail_to('justin@labratrevenge.com', 'email me', :encode => :hex) %> with any ideas you have in mind.  You can also <%= link_to 'follow me on twitter', 'http://twitter.com/Caged' %></p>
